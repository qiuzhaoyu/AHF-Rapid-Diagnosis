# ü´Ä AHF-Rapid-Diagnosis  

This repository provides the official implementation and demonstration codes for **rapid diagnosis of Acute Heart Failure (AHF) from short-duration heart sound recordings**.  
The framework integrates advanced signal processing techniques with lightweight deep learning models to enable **efficient and accurate clinical decision support** in time-critical scenarios.
